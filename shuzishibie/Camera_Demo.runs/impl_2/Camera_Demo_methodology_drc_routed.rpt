2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-13#1 Warning
combinational multiplier  
Detected combinational multiplier in DSP instance rgb_test0/inst/Address1.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock MIPI_Trans_Driver/camera_clock/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock pclk and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer  
One or more logic synchronizer has been detected between 2 clock domains but the synchronizer does not have the property ASYNC_REG defined on one or both registers. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT MIPI_Trans_Driver/Data_Read/U0/clock_system_inst/dly_gen.BUFGCTRL_inst_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on i_camera_iic_sda relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on i_rst relative to clock(s) MIPI_Trans_Driver/camera_clock/inst/clk_in1, sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on i_rx_data_n[0] relative to clock(s) dphy_hs_clock_p
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on i_rx_data_n[1] relative to clock(s) dphy_hs_clock_p
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on i_rx_data_p[0] relative to clock(s) dphy_hs_clock_p
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on i_rx_data_p[1] relative to clock(s) dphy_hs_clock_p
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led relative to clock(s) MIPI_Trans_Driver/camera_clock/inst/clk_in1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on o_camera_iic_scl relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock MIPI_Trans_Driver/camera_clock/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin MIPI_Trans_Driver/camera_clock/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ *SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '2' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].

REQP-1959#1 Advisory
connects_SERDES_RST_driver_not_FF  
MIPI_Trans_Driver/Data_Read/U0/bits_gen[0].line_if_inst/ISERDESE2_inst: The RST pin should only be driven by a Flip-flop.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1959#2 Advisory
connects_SERDES_RST_driver_not_FF  
MIPI_Trans_Driver/Data_Read/U0/bits_gen[1].line_if_inst/ISERDESE2_inst: The RST pin should only be driven by a Flip-flop.
